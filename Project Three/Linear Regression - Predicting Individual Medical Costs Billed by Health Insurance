## Exploratory Data Analysis
There are 1338 observations and 7 variables. In this dataset, 50.52317% are males, 42.899% do not have any children, 79.52% are non-smokers, and 27.20% reside in the southeast region of the U.S. The mean age is 39.21 and the standard deviation is 14.05. The mean BMI is 30.66 with a standard deviation of 6.10. The mean charges are $13270.42 with a standard deviation of $12110.01.

## Data Visualization
Figure 1 shows that the median and lower 50% of charges for males and females are similar. There is a wider range of charges for females in the upper quartile compared to males. Figure 2 shows that the median charges for any number of children are similar with a wider range of charges for the upper 50%. Figure 3 shows that people who smoke have overall higher medical bills charged by their health insurance. The median charges for smokers is over $3000 while it is less than $1000 for non-smokers. The outliers for non-smokers falls in the 50% of charges for smokers. Figure 4 shows that the median charges as well as the lower 75% of costs are similar for all regions. Figure 5 shows that higher bmi is associated with higher medical costs with the points scattered much higher. Figure 6 shows that on average those who are older tend to have higher medical costs.

## Multiple Linear Regression Results
For a 1-year increase in the average age, the medical bill charges increases by an average of $257.19, holding all other variables in the model constant. As for a 1-point increase in the average BMI, the medical bill charges increases by an average of $336.91, holding all other variables in the model constant. The amount of medical charges for males is $128.16 less than those for females, holding all other variables in the model constant. The amount of medical charges for smokers is $23836.41 higher than those for non-smokers, holding all other variables in the model constant. Medical charges were $380.04 less in the northwest region than those in the northeast region, holding all other variables in the model constant.Medical charges were $1033.14 less in the southeast region than those in the northeast region, holding all other variables in the model constant. Medical charges were $952.89.14 less in the southwest region than those in the northeast region, holding all other variables in the model constant. The age, bmi, 2 children, and smoking status were all significant for on average higher medical charges.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide", include=FALSE}
# insert linear regression code

multi <- lm(charges ~ age + factor(sex) + bmi + factor(children) + factor(smoker) + factor(region), data = is)
summary(multi)
```

## Linear Regression Assumptions
We have violated the homoscedasticity assumption because the red line in the scale-location plot has a positive slope to it and the data points are not randomly spread out. 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# regression assumption plots code
plot(multi)
