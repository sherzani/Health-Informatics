## Introduction
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. 

This report seeks to identify target populations for physical health interventions. In order to identify these target populations, we would like to perform statistical testing in order to determine whether or not the interventions should differ across different demographics. One demographic variable we are interested in looking into is sex. 

The BRFSS includes a section on the Health-Related Quality of Life. In order to measure the "Number of Days Physical Health Not Good", respondents were asked: *Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good?* This question will be used as a proxy to measure overall physical health for survey respondents, where the higher the number of days indicated, the lower overall physical health. The following analysis seeks to determine whether the **Number of Days Physical Health Not Good is greater in males, compared to females.**

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
For the purpose of calculations, values over 30 in the PHYSHLTH column were changed to NA. Also, another column called SEX2 was the duplicate for column SEX. SEX2 had recoded values for "male" and "female" to represent the integers 1 and 2 from SEX. The overal mean of PHYSHLTH is 15. There are 2264 females and 996 males in this dataset.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide", include=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(summarytools)

# read in BRFSS file
setwd("/Users/zainabsherani/Desktop/INST408F/HW Two/")
br <- read.csv("BRFSS-1.csv")

# recode values over 30 to NA
br$PHYSHLTH[br$PHYSHLTH > 30] <- NA

# create a new variable and recode numeric values of 1 = male and 2 = female 
br <- mutate(br, SEX2 = SEX)
br$SEX2[br$SEX2 == 1] <- "male"
br$SEX2[br$SEX2 == 2] <- "female"

# mean of PHYSHLTH
round(mean(br$PHYSHLTH, na.rm = T), 1)

# count of F and M 
table(br$SEX2)

```


# Data Visualization
Quartile One and Quartile Four are the same for both sexes which means that 25% of those interviwed had similar number of bad physical health days on the upper and lower ends. The Inter-quartile range with the box is identical which is 50% of interviewees. The only difference between males and females is that the median for males is slightly higher.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Module 7 - Live Coding
ggplot(data=br) +
    geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x=as.factor(SEX2), y=PHYSHLTH,fill=as.factor(SEX2))) + 
    labs(title="Plot of Number of Days Physical Health Not Good by Sex",x="Sex", y = "Number of Days Physical Health Not Good", fill="Sex")
```

## Hypothesis Test
**Null Hypothesis** = The mean number of days physical health is not good for males is less than or equal to that for females. 

**Alternative Hypothesis** = The mean number of days physical health is not good is greater for males than for females.

**Alpha** = 0.05

**Type of test (upper, lower, two-sided)** = upper-tailed

**P-Value** = 0.1725
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide", include=FALSE}
with(br, wilcox.test(x=br$PHYSHLTH[br$SEX2=="male"], 
                          y=br$PHYSHLTH[br$SEX2=="female"],
                     alternative = "greater"))
```

## Conclusion
Our p-value of 0.1725 is **greater than** our alpha, 0.05. 

*At a significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that we do not have statistically significant evidence that the mean number of days physical health is not good is greater for males than for females.*

The biggest problem with this dataset is that there are much fewer males in this dataset compared to females which skew the results. Our conclusion based off this dataset may not be representative of the general population as a result.
